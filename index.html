       <h1>Cats & Dogs <strong>a Debate</strong></h1>
       <CATS>
       <p>1. CATS ARE QUIET
If noise levels are a concern in your living situation, cats are a great choice of pet. Even the quietest bark will likely be much louder than the most insistent meowing. Depending on the cat, you may need to worry about other sounds such as them knocking things off of surfaces or running around at top speed, but they are still likely to be more quiet overall.  
<h4>2. CATS ARE LOW MAINTENANCE</h4>
Compared to dogs, cats are a low maintenance pet. They don’t require formal training, they don’t need to be taken out multiple times a day, and they’re even able to take care of basic self-cleaning. Of course, long-haired cats will still require regular grooming, but it will likely involve less regular grooming than long-haired dogs.</h4>
<h4>3. CATS ARE EASY TO HOUSE-TRAIN
One of the biggest challenges dog owners need to overcome is the process of house-training a new puppy. Kittens, on the other hand, usually know how to use the litter box as soon as you bring them home. All you need to do is show them where it is, and they’ll instinctively use it.  </h4>
<h4>4. CATS MAKE GREAT APARTMENT PETS
When it comes to pets in apartments, cats are often better suited than dogs. Compared to dogs, cats require less space and can take better advantage of vertical space. Even in apartments with small square footage, you can make the space comfortable for cats by adding different vertical levels. Plus, since they use litter boxes, they don’t need to be taken outside multiple times a day – something that can be time-consuming if you live in a large apartment building.</h4>
<h4>5. CATS COST LESS TO CARE FOR
According to the ASPCA, the overall cost of caring for cats is lower than medium or large dogs. This is because they require less food, fewer toys, and have lower overall grooming costs.</h4>
<h4>6. CATS ARE INDEPENDENT
One of the best things about cats is that they are very independent creatures. Unlike dogs, who require quite a high level of attention each day, cats are quite happy to have time to themselves. In fact, cats will sleep for about 15 hours a day so you don’t have to worry about them being too bored when you’re at work. When you are home, cats are also more likely to be content with just being in your company, whereas dogs may demand your undivided attention.</h4>
<h4>7. CATS HAVE A LONG LIFESPAN
Any pet owner knows that losing a pet is a truly heartbreaking experience. Fortunately, when it comes to house pets, cats have quite a long life expectancy. The average life span of a cat is 12 years, but it’s not uncommon for them to live into their high teens or even early twenties.</h4>
<h4>8. CATS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH
Studies have shown that cats have a calming effect on their owners, from the soothing action of petting to purring being an aid in falling asleep. Cats can even play a part in lowering your blood pressure and risk of a heart attack. One 10-year study has even shown that cat owners were 30% less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat owners.</h4>
<h4>9. CATS CAN LEAD TO FEWER ALLERGIES
In a study by the National Institutes of Health, it was found that children under the age of one who were exposed to a cat were less likely to develop allergies. The interesting part was that this wasn’t just limited to pet allergies, but all types of allergies. It appears that exposure to pets as a young child will protect you against not only pet allergies, but other common allergies such as dust mites, ragweed, and grass.</h4>
<h4>10. CATS KEEP UNWANTED PESTS OUT OF YOUR HOUSE
Cats are hardwired to stalk, hunt, and pounce on their prey, which makes them perfect for keeping your home free of unwanted pests – be it mice, bugs, or something else. Even their presence can be enough of a deterrent for rodents as their scent can act as a repellent. Your living situation may impact the type of pet you’re able to have, but if you are fortunate enough to have unlimited animal options, we hope that these 10 reasons show you why a cat makes the ideal companion.</h4>

<h4> 1) Training Dogs Is Easier:
One reason why dogs prove popular is that they train easier compared to cats. Dogs can be taught tricks, manners, behaviors, and commands. You can do this for protection and safety, obedience, and even simple amusement. Dogs actually love training because they love having tasks and being part of a pack. Cats can be trained some, but once they bore they’ll swat the treat out of your hand and run off with it.</h4>
<h4> 2) Dogs Offer Protection:
Dogs will guard your home from burglars and strangers, but cats aren’t going to do this. They’re timid, prone to running off when someone strange comes in. Even the tiniest of dogs have heart, and their audible bark is enough to make some burglars go break into someone else’s home. Many dogs will even wake you up if there’s a fire, which is practically unthinkable for a cat to do.</h4>
<h4> 3) Loyalty:
There’s a reason dogs are called man’s best friend. They’ll tilt their heads, trying to understand every one of your words while trying to make you feel better when you’re sad. Cats are just going to ignore you and nap some more. Dogs are such social creatures that their relaxed owners tend to have lower blood pressure and longer lifespans, even when living alone, as compared to those who don’t own any pets at all.</h4>
<h4> 4) Your Dog Keeps You Fit:
Dogs have to walk, which means you probably get to walk too. Walking is a low-impact form of cardio that does wonders for your legs, low back, and midsection. One study even found that seniors owning dogs walked an average distance of a mile per day.</h4>
<h4> 5) Dogs Get You Laughing:
Whether intentionally or otherwise, you laugh at your dog, or more hopefully with him. One pilot study looked into this, studying 95 people across dog owners, cat owners, and those without any pets. Among the three groups, dog owners laughed most frequently. Cat owners actually laughed less frequently than those without pets at all, so there’s actually some statistical evidence that cats are downers!</h4>
<h4> 6) Dogs Are Tech-Savvy!
Cats are savvy enough to rip all the tissues out of a box and rip them to shreds, but some dogs are technologically advanced enough to recognize and even respond to various written commands on a tablet, such as ‘sit.’ A few have even started mastering selfies. A company based in the UK offers training sessions so your dog can learn how to take good-looking photos of himself, just by nose-swiping the screen!</h4>
<h4> 7) Dogs Come In All Sizes:
You can fill your tiny apartment with the relentless heart of a Chihuahua or let majestic Great Pyrenees roam your mansion. There’s a dog size suitable to your needs and preferences somewhere along the scale.</h4>
8) Dogs Are Heroes:
The discerning noses of dogs make them very useful in all kinds of crime-fighting applicants, whether it’s manhunts for fugitives, finding missing kids, or sniffing out bombs. Medical applications are under research too. Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania are actually training German Shepards and Golden Retrievers how they can sniff out ovarian cancer.</h4>
<h4> 9) Dogs Might Prevent Asthma And Allergies:
Kids that get exposure to ‘dog dust’ might have lower risks of developing asthma and allergies later in their life. That’s based on research conducted on mice. Dog dust looks like it has microbes which influence how many immune cells wind up responding to allergens.</h4>
<h4> 10) Dogs Don’t Use Litter Boxes:
Well, if they do, something went really wrong along the way. Even those who love cats hate litter boxes (Check our recommended cat litters). Regardless of how well-maintained they are, the smell lingers and the litter gets tracked all over their home. Finding the ideal spot for a litter box is also problematic in a small home. Dogs get to be house-trained, and most will stick to their schedule. They’ll wait to do their business during a walk or in the yard. It’s only necessary to pick up their poop, but cat owners have to deal with urine in litter boxes. Poop isn’t so bad with the right bags or pooper scooper. It’s still not that glorious, but it’s better than dealing with things inside your home.
Cat owners could probably point out a few reasons why cats are better than dogs, but they’re too busy pulling dead mice out of their slippers. If you train your dog right, he’ll fetch you yours.</h4>
